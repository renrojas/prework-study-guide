        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element is a browser element that contains information about the webpage-not the user.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>HTMl is used to build a sturdy frame, using HTML elements as the building blocks.</li>
          <li>Doctype declaration tells the browser what doctument type should expect when it is opened.</li>
          <li>Doctype is not case sensitive; HTML elements are case-sensitive</li>
          <li>An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element</li>
          <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning elemnt, never the closing element</li>
          <li>Head element contains the metadata -data about the webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to those that use it.</li>
          <li>Title is required for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS is added to define style style.</li>
          <li>Separation of concerns refers to separating code into different files based on use. It is based on the idea that each section of code should have its own responsibility.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. Margin is not visible on the page, it adds a buffer.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element. Padding is transparent, it makes the entire element bigger which is locsted inside the element.</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle to reuse/share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained. </li>
