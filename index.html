        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element is a browser element that contains information about the webpage-not the user.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>HTML is used to build a sturdy frame, using HTML elements as the building blocks.</li>
          <li>Doctype declaration tells the browser what doctument type should expect when it is opened.</li>
          <li>Doctype is not case sensitive; HTML elements are case-sensitive</li>
          <li>An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element</li>
          <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning elemnt, never the closing element</li>
          <li>Head element contains the metadata -data about the webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to those that use it.</li>
          <li>Title is required for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS is added to define style style.</li>
          <li>Separation of concerns refers to separating code into different files based on use. It is based on the idea that each section of code should have its own responsibility.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. Margin is not visible on the page, it adds a buffer.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element. Padding is transparent, it makes the entire element bigger which is locsted inside the element.</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle to reuse/share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained. </li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is added to HTML structure to make the website interactive.</li>
          <li>var: A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>All strings are surrounded by quotation marks.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page.</li>
          <li>Conditional statements and loops control the order in which code is executed - interrupts control flow.</li>
          <li>When creating an if statement, we provide one or more conditions for the computer to evaluate. If one condition is truthy, the computer will execute the code that we provide between curly brackets. But if the condition is not truthy, the code will not execute, interrupting the control flow.</li>
          <li>falsy if it is one of the following values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false. </li>
          <li>strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>A function must be called for it to be executed, otherwise it will not be executed at all.</li>
